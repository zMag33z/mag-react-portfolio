## Design:

*This* 'Professional Portfolio' react site was a class assignment.  In week-2 of bootcamp, class was given an assignment to create a Portfolio using css and html 'ONLY'.  In week-20, class was given a new direction to follow using 'React'.  The visual aspect/design of *this* Portfolio was based off of week 2's assignment.

## Usage:

Website designed to show prospect employers my skills, qualifications, education, training, and experiences.
